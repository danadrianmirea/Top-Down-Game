# Top-Down-Game
Tutorial game from gamedev.tv that uses OOP and classes to make a simple 2D RPG game

I do not own the sprite sheets used here. These were referenced off of the course: "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners" and are used for learning purposes.
I added my own code on top of the tutorial by adding a win condition (triggered when all enemies are dead).

NOTE: For testing of the solution, raylib is required. A download of the raylib library is found here: https://www.raylib.com/
